    "- more Python centric\n",
    "- uses other cluster-specific projects like [`istio`](https://github.com/istio/istio)\n",
    "- leverages `Service`s out of the box and is all about micro-services defined with `Pipelines` (described later)\n",
    "\n",
    "## What can I use it for?\n",

    "- Experimentation and hyper-parameter tuning via [`katib`](https://www.kubeflow.org/docs/components/katib/) (way faster due to parallelization across cluster)\n",

    "\n",
    "- Components __should use local files unless not possible__ (Cloud ML Engine and BigQuery require Cloud Storage staging paths)\n",
    "- Aforementioned __pure components__ (e.g. no side-effects and modifying anything without \"telling `kubeflow`\")\n",
    "- __Mix and match programming languages__ - DO NOT STICK TO `python` IF IT IS NOT BENEFICIAL! __How?__:\n",
    "    - Create `Docker` image containing `golang` app which requires some `input`s and outputs\n",
    "    - Define `.yaml` directly\n",
    "    - __Use inter-language formats for data exchange__ (e.g. `JSON`, `CSV`, `ProtoBuf` etc.)\n",
    "    - One can do small pre-processing for different languages with `shell` scripts (__SMALL ONES!__)\n",
    "- __One output == one file__\n",
    "- __Do not pollute with temporary data__. Why? __It might/will be preserved by `PersistentVolume`__\n",
    "- __STAY LOCAL FOR AS LONG AS POSSIBLE__ - it's always easier and less stressful, e.g. unit testing specific component\n",
    "- __Test in isolation__ - single container; if not possible, run `minikube` or a-like before going with `kubeadm` and full-blown cluster (way easier to debug)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Feedback from AiCore\n",
    "\n",
    "- __Do not use function-based components for more complicated workflows__ as it allows you to use packages and `python` best practices more freely\n",
    "- __Do not \"overkill\"__: keep the services within \"reasonable size\", for example:\n",
    "    - `microservice` to transform data instead of:\n",
    "        - `microservice` to load data\n",

    "    - Easier customization of `Dockerfile` (although one can almost always deploy `image` beforehand and use it from within `python`)\n",

    "\n",
    "### DSL\n",
    "\n",
    "- Go through [`kfp.dsl`](https://kubeflow-pipelines.readthedocs.io/en/latest/source/kfp.dsl.html) documentation. What others methods could you use to the define the `pipeline`?

    "### Kubernetes\n",

    "- Check how to directly manipulate `k8s` objects [here](https://www.kubeflow.org/docs/components/pipelines/sdk/manipulate-resources/). __It should not be done in general__ and `k8s` objects are better provided more \"statically\", but it is worth knowing one can do this from `kubeflow`.\n",

    "\n",
    "- Check out [`min.io`](https://min.io/) for better understanding of the cloud-native and `k8s` first data foramt\n",
    "- Read about basics of [`argoproj`](https://github.com/argoproj/argo-workflows/) which is used by `kubeflow` to orchestrate workflows\n",
    "- `feast` feature store can be used together with `kubeflow`. Check [relevant documentation](https://www.kubeflow.org/docs/external-add-ons/feature-store/overview/) __and use it after `feast` was presented by `AiCore` team!__\n",
