    "> AWS Lambda is a serverless computing service allowing you to run code in response to events without having to manage backend servers, runtimes, create workload aware cluster logic or maintain event integrations. Allowing you to run code for any type of application or backend service with zero administration.\n",

    "\n",
    "The code run that will execute on the AWS Service is called a Lambda function, once created it will always be avaliable to run once it's triggered. Each function you create will have the code as well as the associated configuration information required for the function to run. Allowing each function to be **stateless**, meaning it's a self contained function without external dependencies. This allows you to launch as multiple copies of the function that may be required to keep up with incoming requests and events.\n",
    "\n",
    "These functions can also be easily integrated with specific AWS resources such as: Amazon S3, API Gateway, Lex or Cognito and even call other Lambda functions! When there is a change to the resource you can configure the function to execute adding extra functionality to the resource.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Features \n",
    "\n",
    "* **Extend the logic of other AWS resources:** When there is a change to your resource such as an Amazon S3 bucket you can configure the Lambda function to execute, managing the incoming data.\n",
    "* **Develop your own code** With Lamabda there are no new languages or tools to learn. You can use any third party libraries and even package (frameworks, SDKs,libaries and more) into a Lambda layer. Currently Lambda natively supports Java, Go, Powershell, Node.js, C#, Python and Ruby.\n",
    "* **Zero administration** Lambda mananges all the infastruture for you on a highly fault tolerant infastructure allowing you to focus on building services.\n",
    "* **Highly Scalable** Lambda functions are only run when needed so will only run at the rate of incoming requests without any configuration. It will run the function within milliseconds of an event and only execute for the required time to fufill the requests down to the millisecond. "
