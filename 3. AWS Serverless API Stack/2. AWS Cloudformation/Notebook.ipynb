    "## What is AWS CloudFormation\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "> AWS CloudFormation is an AWS service that helps you setup and manage your AWS resources and services infastructure. It allows you to design the **Infastructure as Code** allowing you more time to focus on building your AWS applications. By defining a YAML or JSON template you can describe all the AWS resources required(like EC2, AWS RDS or S3) by your application and CloudFormation will handle the provisioning of those resources for you. \r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "For full details on what is possible with AWS CloudFormation consult the documentation [here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/index.html).\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "### Benefits of using CloudFormation\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "* **Simplifies creating your application infastructure:** Imagine your application infastruture was to deploy an EC2 instance and S3 bucket with the correct security permissions. Doing this manually can be very time consuming, by defining the process in a template you can quickly create another instance of this infastructure in a few clicks.\r\n",
    "* **Replicate your architecture:** Since your CloudFormation infastructure is defined in code by your template, you can easily reuse the template to deploy the same infastruture to another AWS region.\r\n",
    "* **Track changes easily:** If you want to make changes to your infastructure for instance updating security permission to your EC2 instance. If a problem occured while doing this then you would need to remember the previous settings. CloudFormation provides a rollback feature to use a previous version of your template if a problem occurs and tracks the changes made.\r\n",
    "* **Free to use:** CloudFormation is fully free to use but be aware that the services your define in your template will have the normal associated costs. Each template does have limited quotas when being created and the quotas can be viewed [here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/index.html).\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "### CloudFormation Concepts\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "* **Template:** Template can be specified in JSON or YAML format and act as the blueprint for your AWS infrastructure. It will define the resources used and how they are configured when added to the stack.\r\n",
    "* **Stack:** After configuring your AWS template and deploying it your resources will be managed in a single object called a stack. From the stack you can update, delete, create resources to your stack defined by the template. \r\n",
    "* **Change sets:** Allow you to generate a summary of proposed changes which will be made to your stack before updating it. Since AWS destroys the previous stack when updating a new one you can view the changes to ensure no critcal elements are affected when updating the new stack. \r\n"

    "## Creating CloudFormation Templates\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "Before you can begin to use the CloudFormation we will need to design a template that we can upload to create our stack. We have the option to create the template in YAML and JSON, we will be using YAML for the purposes of this notebook. The YAML template is where you will configure your AWS resources to be added to your stack. The full avaliable structure of an AWS CloudFormation template can be found [here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/template-anatomy.html).\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "Below is a basic template with defines a simple AWS CloudFormation stack configuring an EC2 instance. The general process of creating a CloudFormation template will be to define the AWS resources that your CloudFormation stack will contain and then define the properties for each of those resources. In the example we have defined a new Unbuntu EC2 instance, notice the properties of the resource(ImageId, InstanceType and Amazon EBS storage) make sense for an EC2 instance.  \r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "Some properties for your resource will be required, have defaults or be fully optional, to understand which properties and what resources are avaliable for your template. You can consult the resource and property reference of the CloudFormation documentation [here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/aws-template-resource-type-ref.html).\r\n",
