    "> ## FastAPI is a library to create web APIs quick and efficiently\n",
    "\n",
    "Some advantages about using FastAPI with respect to other web frameworks is that:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. __It is intentionally easy to use__: The code structure and its encapsulation make it very intuitive to find the methods you are looking for in no time\n",
    "2. __Fast to code__: FastAPI integrates all the hard work for you, simply add the type of request to be expected, and the response according to said request.\n",
    "3. __It uses both OpenAPI and JSON__: This way, not only your browser will be able to display the data nicely, but also, the user will be able to retrieve the data efficiently.\n",
    "4. __Queries are much easier to format__: Remember that lesson about type hinting? This is where it comes in extremely handy. By default your queries will have `str` format, but if you give a specific type hint in your functions, the input will be casted to that type\n",
    "5. __It was asynchroniusly__: You don't have to make the changes effectively as you make changes to your API. FastAPI works in a ASGI framework that allows you to visualize changes before being deployed. \n",
    "6. __It integrates Dataclasses__: As you remember, these decorators are very convenient when defining classes, which will make your application much easier to be up and running\n",
    "7. __It integrates pytest__: Your functions can be easily tested before being deployed.\n",
    "\n",
    "FastAPI is relatively new (compared to Flask or Django for example), but it is increasing at a higher pace than its counterparts. You might also want to check other libraries such as Tornado or Hug to create applications. However, due to its power and simplicity, we are going to focus on FastAPI."
