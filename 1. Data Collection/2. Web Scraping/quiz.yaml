    question: Select the options whose xpath match the descriptions
  - options:
      - correct: false
        option: Web scrapers should be implemented as functions, but never as classes
      - correct: true
        option: The initialiser should create an instance of a webdriver
      - correct: false
        option: Your imports from Selenium should be inside the class constructor
      - correct: false
        option: When scraping images (or video or other files), you should just save
          the links rather than downloading them - it will save memory, and you'll
          always be able to download them later using that link if you need to
      - correct: true
        option: Scrapers should not scrape pages they have already scraped from. They
          should have some way of keeping track of what they have and haven't collected
          already.
      - correct: true
        option: 'Scrapers should generally have at least 2 methods: 1) to find all
          of the pages you want to scrape and 2) to scrape all of the data from that
          page. It''s better to separate them for readability.'

          process to save time later
      - correct: false

          and use the full XPath, not class names etc. The structure of the page is
          not likely to change, whereas class names are.
